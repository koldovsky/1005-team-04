        <p class="diving-course-about__item">If you have already tried scuba diving, and you liked it, and you
            want to know more, be more independent under the water and dive in the places for certified divers,
            then the Open Water Diver diving course in Phuket is where you need to start.
        </p>
        <p class="diving-course-about__item last-item">The course is divided into several parts: theory, practice, and
            of course, diving itself. It's
            simple: you go through all these parts of training in parallel: theory and practice in the pool or
            shallow water, and then real dives in the sea. During the training, you will learn everything that a
            diver should know: how the equipment works and how to use it and take care of it; where and when you
            can dive and how to plan your dives, how to swim under the water. You will learn so much that every
            day will bring you more and more vivid impressions!</p>
