                        <p>Diving in Phuket and diving safaris on the Similan Islands are traditionally among the ten
                            best
                            places in the world for scuba diving. Phuket dive sites are famous for their variety of
                            corals
                            and an abundance of underwater fauna.</p>

                <p class="diving-course-about__item">If you have already tried scuba diving, and you liked it, and you
                    want to know more, be more independent under the water and dive in the places for certified divers,
                    then the Open Water Diver diving course in Phuket is where you need to start.
                    The course is divided into several parts: theory, practice, and of course, diving itself. It's
                    simple: you go through all these parts of training in parallel: theory and practice in the pool or
                    shallow water, and then real dives in the sea. During the training, you will learn everything that a
                    diver should know: how the equipment works and how to use it and take care of it; where and when you
                    can dive and how to plan your dives, how to swim under the water. You will learn so much that every
                    day will bring you more and more vivid impressions!</p>
